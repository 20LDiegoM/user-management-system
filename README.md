# User Management System in WordPress

This project is a **custom user management system** built in WordPress, allowing users to register, log in, and access different levels of information based on their assigned roles. 

## Features:
- **Custom Roles:** Cool Kid, Cooler Kid, and Coolest Kid, each with specific access permissions.
- **Profile Management:** Users can view their information and, depending on their role, access limited details of other users.
- **Secure API Endpoints:** Administrators can change user roles via a **protected API endpoint**.
- **JWT Authentication:** Ensures secure access to protected resources.
- **Automatic User Data Generation:** Uses the `randomuser.me` API to create user profiles.

This system follows **WordPress best practices**, including **WordPress Coding Standards**, and implements **JWT authentication** for enhanced security.
